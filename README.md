# S-Project-1-Hotel-Management-Database-Design-Normalization-SQL-Operations-MySQL-
This project consists of the full lifecycle of designing and implementing a **Hotel Management System database**.   Across three stages, we built an ERD, created tables, populated data, normalized the schema to 3NF,   and practiced core SQL operations (DDL, DML, DQL).
